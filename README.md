## golinks+

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [jkulton/golinks](https://github.com/jkulton/golinks). Major differences from the original:
>
> - golinks are opened with the omnibox keyword `go` + <kbd>Space</kbd> instead of `go/` URLs, so the extension doesn't need `declarativeNetRequest` redirect rules
> - As you type, the omnibox suggests golinks by fuzzy match and shows the URL of each
> - Text after a slash is appended to the golink's URL (`go gh/bsara/golinks-plus` opens `https://github.com/bsara/golinks-plus`)
> - `go links` or `go /` opens the index
> - Shared golinks can be loaded from a CSV URL, such as a Google Sheet. Personal golinks override shared ones with the same name
> - New shared golinks can be created through a configurable URL template, from the create page or automatically for unknown `go` links
> - Host permissions are optional. They are only requested for a shared CSV URL, so files that need you to be signed in can be loaded

golinks in your browser, without the need to modify DNS settings or run a server.

This is an unpacked Chrome extension which leverages Chrome's [`omnibox`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/omnibox) API to function as an all-in-one golinks system for personal use.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> golink data can be kept entirely **local**, using Chrome's [`storage.local`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage#storage_areas). Loading golinks from a shared CSV and creating links in it are optional.

### Installation

1. Clone (or download) this repo
2. Go to **Manage Extensions** in your Chrome-based browser (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Toggle **Developer mode** on, then click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned/downloaded repo
4. The extension should install and open the help page

### Usage

Type `go`, press <kbd>Space</kbd>, then type a name to search your golinks.

### Shared golinks

Load shared golinks from a CSV file at a URL, for example a team's Google Sheet or a GitHub Gist.

<img src="/images/screenshot-shared-golinks.png" />

1. On the index page, enter the URL in **Shared CSV URL** and click **Save**
2. When Chrome asks for access to the site, allow it if the file needs you to be signed in (such as a private Google Sheet)
3. Select **Ignore the first line (header row)** if the file has a header

Each line of the CSV is `name,url`. Lines with an empty name or an invalid URL are skipped.

For a Google Sheet, use its CSV export URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<sheet-id>/export?format=csv`

Shared golinks reload when the browser starts and periodically after that. Click the reload icon next to the URL to reload them now.

On the index page, shared golinks are marked `shared`. A personal golink with the same name overrides the shared one.

### Shared link creation

Add new golinks to the shared CSV through a URL that you configure, for example a Google Form that adds rows to a shared Google Sheet.

1. On the index page, click **Add Shared Link Creation**
2. Enter a URL template and click **Save**

The template can include these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{{name}}` | The URL-encoded link name |
| `{{url}}` | The URL-encoded link URL |
| `{{hasUrl:...}}` | Everything after the colon, only when a URL is given. Can contain `{{name}}` and `{{url}}` |

For example, `https://example.com/new?name={{name}}{{hasUrl:&url={{url}}}}`

On the create page, click **Create Shared Link** to open the filled-in URL. The URL field is optional for shared links. The button is disabled until a shared CSV URL and a template are set.

Select **Open this URL for unknown `go` links** to open the template URL, instead of the create page, when you enter a name that doesn't exist. This also needs a shared CSV URL to be set. Only `{{name}}` is filled in.

### Managed settings

Administrators can set the shared settings through Chrome enterprise policy. The extension reads them from [`storage.managed`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage#property-managed). See `managed_schema.json` for the keys.

A setting set by policy can't be changed on the index page. Settings import and export are hidden while any setting is set by policy. If the policy value is removed, the last value stays and you can change it again. `sharedGolinksCreateOnUnknown` is an exception: its policy value is only a default, used when you haven't set it yourself.

If the shared CSV needs you to be signed in, click the reload icon next to the URL to give the extension access to the site.
